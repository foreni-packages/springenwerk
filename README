Springenwerk v0.4.5 Readme
**************************

Springenwerk is a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) security scanner, written in Python.

This is my first project using Python, so please feel free to tell me about all 
the places in the code where I screwed up.

Use this tool at your own risk (see LICENCE file)!

Be responsible. Use this tool only on your own network and on web applications
that you are explicitly allowed to scan.

This is open source software. Please help make this THE open source XSS scanner 
by using it, providing feedback, writing about it, filing bug reports and feature 
requests, donating, sponsoring, and - of course - by enhancing it.

For installation help, see the INSTALL file.
For usage information, run Springenwerk without any arguments:

  python springenwerk.py

Thank you for using Springenwerk.
